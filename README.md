## View App
You can view the app here https://mab-one.vercel.app/ 

### Note: 
The implementation is slightly different from the plan and the project is currently incomplete. It display events and users can add an event but other functionality has yet to be implemented and data does not persist when the browser is refreshed. In the current working prototype, a template-driven approach was used, but the form structure can be  refactored into a reactive form if needed. 


## Please see below for instructions to set up and run 



This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.15.

Fork and clone the project from the github repository
You will need node installed as well as the Angular CLI. 


## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
